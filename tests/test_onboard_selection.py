"""Driver picks are numbered in tap order, not ticked identically.

Group titles pair two drivers whose names often look alike ("SANON ARLETTE /
DATTUS LIVENSTONN"), and picking the wrong row silently stores the wrong
user_id -- which is the whole point of the picker. Numbering the picks makes a
mis-tap visible before Save.
